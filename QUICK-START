Currently, Bitcoin Core is the only node type that the scantool has been tested with.


Bitcoin Core Setup

1. Run Bitcoin Core with the transaction indexing turned on.
    If you are turning on transaction indexing for the first time, it may take time for all transactions to be indexed.

        txindex=1

Script Analytics Tool Setup

1. Make a copy of the example config file. In this example, we will call it script-analytics-tool.conf.

        $ cp ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>-example.conf ./script-analytics-tool.conf


2. Edit the file to connect to your specific node. Uncomment the lines that will not be using the default values and set them to the appropriate values for your setup.

            bitcoin-core-addr : IP address used in a rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
            bitcoin-core-port : port used in the same rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-username : username in the rpcuser setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-password : password in the rpcpassword setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
                         addr : IP address that the web based block explorer should be made available on
                         port : port that the web based block explorer should be made available on

        Note: There is also a no-web option that allows you to turn off the web interface.


3. Run the script analytics tool using the settings in the config file created in the steps above.

        $ ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION> --config-file=./script-analytics-tool.conf


4. Test the web interface in a browser. Assuming addr was set to 127.0.0.1 and port was set to 8080, the web interface should be available at the following URL.

        http://127.0.0.1:8080


5. Test the REST API. Assuming addr was set to 127.0.0.1 and port was set to 8080, the REST API can be tested as follows.

        $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/v1/current_block_height
