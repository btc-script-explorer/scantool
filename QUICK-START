Currently, Bitcoin Core is the only node type that the scantool has been tested with.


Bitcoin Core Setup

1. Run Bitcoin Core with the transaction indexing turned on.
    If you are turning on transaction indexing for the first time, it may take time for all transactions to be indexed.

        txindex=1

Script Analytics Tool Setup

1. Create a directory where scantool releases can be installed and easily deleted in the future.
   Copy, or download, release files into the new directory.

        $ mkdir scantool
		$ cd scantool

2. Unzip the file and go to the release directory.

        $ tar zxvf ./scantool-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz
        $ cd script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>

3. Make a copy of the example config file. In this example, we will call it scantool.conf.
   In order to reuse the same config file for subsequent versions of the scantool, it is recommended to store the new config file in the parent directory.

        $ cp ./scantool-<VERSION>-example.conf ../scantool.conf


4. Edit the file to connect to your specific node. Uncomment each line and set the value according to the following instructions.

            bitcoin-core-addr : IP address used in a rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
            bitcoin-core-port : port used in the same rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-username : username in the rpcuser setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-password : password in the rpcpassword setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
                         addr : IP address that the web based block explorer should be made available on
                         port : port that the web based block explorer should be made available on

        Note: There is also a no-web option that allows you to turn off the web interface.


5. Run the script analytics tool using the settings in the config file created in the steps above.

        $ ./scantool-<VERSION> --config-file=../scantool.conf


6. Follow the instructions on the screen in order to connect to the web interface and the REST API.
