Currently, Bitcoin Core is the only node type that the scantool has been tested with.


Bitcoin Core Setup

1. Run Bitcoin Core with the following settings at a minimum. This sets up transaction indexing and the RPC API that the scantool will
   use to communicate with the node. If you are turning on transaction indexing for the first time, it may take time for all transactions to be indexed.

        txindex=1
        rpcbind=     [ The address:port that Bitcoin Core broadcasts on. There can be more than one of these. ]
        rpcallowip=  [ The address of the host that the scantool will run on. ]
        rpcuser=     [ Your Bitcoin Core username. ]
        rpcpassword= [ Your Bitcoin Core password. ]

Script Analytics Tool Setup

1. If you already have a config file for scantool, then skip to #2.

        a. Create a directory where scantool releases can be installed.

                $ mkdir scantool

        b. Copy or download the release file into the newly-create directory.
           This step can be done in various ways, so we will assume that the release file is now in the scantool directory.

        c. Enter the scantool directory.

                $ cd scantool

        d. Unzip the release file and enter the release directory.

                $ tar zxvf ./scantool-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz

        e. Enter the release directory.

                $ cd script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>

        f. Make a copy of the example config file. In this example, we will call it scantool.conf.
           In order to reuse the same config file for subsequent versions of the scantool, it is recommended to store the new config file in the parent directory (scantool in this example).

                $ cp ./scantool-<VERSION>-example.conf ../scantool.conf


        g. Edit the file to connect to your specific node. Uncomment each line and set the value according to the following instructions.

                    bitcoin-core-addr : IP address used in a rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
                    bitcoin-core-port : port used in the same rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
                bitcoin-core-username : username in the rpcuser setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
                bitcoin-core-password : password in the rpcpassword setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
                                 addr : IP address that the web based block explorer should be made available on
                                 port : port that the web based block explorer should be made available on

                Note: There is also a no-web option that allows you to turn off the web interface.


2. Run the script analytics tool using the settings in the config file created in the steps above.

        $ ./scantool-<VERSION> --config-file=../scantool.conf


3. Follow the instructions on the screen in order to connect to the web interface and the REST API.


To stop the scantool, use Ctrl+C.
