Bitcoin Core Setup

1. Run Bitcoin Core with the transaction indexing turned on.
    If you are turning on transaction indexing for the first time, it may take time for all transactions to be indexed.

        txindex=1

Script Analytics Tool Setup

1. Unzip the application and navigate to the application folder. Then copy the config file to another filename.
   The filename can be anything you choose. In this example, we will use script-analytics-tool.conf.

        $ tar zxvf ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>.tar.gz
        $ cd ./script-analytics-tool
        $ cp ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>-example.conf ./script-analytics-tool.conf

2. Edit the file to connect to your specific node. Uncomment the lines that will not be using the default values and set them to the appropriate values for your setup.
   The following settings should be set.

            bitcoin-core-addr : Set this to the IP address used in a rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file.
            bitcoin-core-port : Set this to the port used in the same rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file.
        bitcoin-core-username : Set this to the username in the rpcuser setting in the Bitcoin Core config file.
        bitcoin-core-password : Set this to the password in the rpcpassword setting in the Bitcoin Core config file.
                         addr : Set this to the IP address that the web based block explorer should be made available on.
                         port : Set this to the port that the web based block explorer should be made available on.

3. Run the script analytics tool using the settings in the config file created in the steps above.

        $ ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION> --config-file=./script-analytics-tool.conf

4. Test the web interface in a browser. Assuming addr was set to 127.0.0.1 and port was set to 8080, the web interface should be available at the following URL.

        http://127.0.0.1:8080

5. Test the REST API. Assuming addr was set to 127.0.0.1 and port was set to 8080, the REST API can be tested as follows.

        $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/v1/current_block_height
