1. Run Bitcoin Core with the transaction indexing turned on.
    If you are turning on transaction indexing for the first time, it may take time for all transactions to be indexed.

        txindex=1

Script Analytics Tool Setup

1. Unzip the application and navigate to the application folder.
   Make a copy of the example config file. In this example, we will call it script-analytics-tool.conf.

        $ tar zxvf ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>-docker.tar.gz
        $ cd ./script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>
        $ cp ./scantool-example-docker.conf ./scantool.conf


2. Edit scantool.conf to connect to your specific node. Uncomment the lines that will not be using the default values and set them to the appropriate values for your setup.

            bitcoin-core-addr : IP address used in a rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
            bitcoin-core-port : port used in the same rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-username : username in the rpcuser setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-password : password in the rpcpassword setting in the Bitcoin Core config file


3. Run the script analytics tool using the settings in the config file created in the steps above.

        $ ./docker-run.sh


4. Follow the directions on the screen as for how to use the web interface and REST API.
