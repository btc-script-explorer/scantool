Currently, Bitcoin Core is the only node type that the scantool has been tested with.


Bitcoin Core Setup

1. Run Bitcoin Core with the following settings at a minimum. This sets up transaction indexing and the RPC API that the scantool will
   use to communicate with the node. If you are turning on transaction indexing for the first time, it may take time for all transactions to be indexed.

        txindex=1
        rpcbind=     [ The address:port that Bitcoin Core broadcasts on. There can be more than one of these. ]
        rpcallowip=  [ The address of the host that the scantool will run on. (Not the address of the docker container.) ]
        rpcuser=     [ Your Bitcoin Core username. ]
        rpcpassword= [ Your Bitcoin Core password. ]

Script Analytics Tool Setup

1. Create a directory where scantool releases can be installed.
   Then copy, or download, the release files into the new directory.

        $ mkdir scantool
		$ cd scantool

2. Unzip the file and go to the release directory.

        $ tar zxvf ./scantool-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>-docker.tar.gz
        $ cd script-analytics-tool-<VERSION>-docker

3. Make a copy of the example config file. In this example, we will call it scantool.conf.
   In order to reuse the same config file for subsequent versions of the scantool, it is recommended to store the new config file in the parent directory.

        $ cp ./scantool-<VERSION>-example-docker.conf ../scantool.conf


4. Edit the file to connect to your specific node. Uncomment each line and set the value according to the following instructions.
   For this step, we must pick exactly one rpcbind line from our Bitcoin Core config file.

            bitcoin-core-addr : IP address from the rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core
            bitcoin-core-port : port from the rpcbind setting in the Bitcoin Core
        bitcoin-core-username : username in the rpcuser setting in the Bitcoin Core config file
        bitcoin-core-password : password in the rpcpassword setting in the Bitcoin Core

        Note: There is also a no-web option that allows you to turn off the web interface.


5. Run the scantool docker startup script and pass it the path to the config file created in the steps above.

        $ ./run-scantool-<VERSION>-docker.sh ../scantool.conf


6. Follow the instructions on the screen in order to connect to the web interface and the REST API.


To stop the scantool, run docker stop <container name>
To see all running containers, run docker container list
