## What It Is

The application is primarily a research tool that can also be used as a learning tool. The main use cases are as follows.

- Block Explorer
  - The block explorer displays all serialized scripts instead of only showing them as a hex field of an input script or segregated witness block like most block explorers do.

- REST API
  - A REST API is provided for the purpose of automated analysis of transactions and scripts.
